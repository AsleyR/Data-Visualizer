All kinds of contributions are welcome!

- Wrong documentation? Technical mistakes happen all the time.
- Is there something you didn't understand right away? Was the explanation too
  complicated?
- Any other suggestions for improvement? Better wording? Typos? Dead links?
- Want to translate the readme or the program? Go for it.

Please report _anything_ that seems wrong to you by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/AsleyR/Data-Visualizer/issues) for it.

If you feel like fixing it yourself, open a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests). Although, please read the [guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for making a pull request before all. The contents of the patch are very important to me, but so is keeping a control of the project. 

Thank you in advance for following the guideliens and for contributing! ðŸŽ‰
