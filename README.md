# data_visualizer
### V. 1.0
A simple python program that visualizes data from a .csv file. It uses the library PySimpleGui for its GUI. 

At the moment, this program can only read data from .csv files, so, it is not very useful to be honest. Nonetheless, I plan to allow the program to read data from a database, although don't ask me how am I going to do that lmao.
