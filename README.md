<h1> Project Description</h1>

A python program that visualizes data from a `.csv` file. It uses the [PySimpleGui](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI) gui library for its GUI, and [PyDub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/) for some simple error audio handling. 

At the moment, this program can only read data from `.csv` files, but in the future I plan on adding support for other filetypes, and an option to connect to a SQL or a MongoDb database.

# Installation

If you want to test the program yourself, I recommend you visit the page [mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) to get some sample data in `.csv` format.

### Using pip

Data visualizer can be installed with pip. To do so, run the follow command:

```
pip install data-visualizer
```

### From source

On the other hand, if you want to, you can also download the program from the repo. If you want to do so, follow these steps to do so.

1. Clone the repo into your local machine:

<div align="center">
<img src="data_visualizer/media/gifs/clone-repo.gif" width="500" alt="gif-clone-repo">
</div>

<br>

  2. Open the cloned folder and run the `"data_visualizer"` folder as a module with the following command:

  ```python
  python3 -m data_visualizer
  ```

## Dependencies

By default, Data Visualizer's `setup.py` file was setup in a way that automatically downloads all the packages the program uses and depends of. However, if for some reason you want to install them yourself, Data Visualizer requires the PySimpleGui and PyDub libraries to work.

You can install them with pip using the following commands:

```shell
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

```shell
pip install pydub
```

In the case that you don't have pip, scroll down a little bit to see how to install it.

## Pip installation (optional)

Don't have pip? You can install it like this:

<h4>Linux & MacOs</h4>

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip
```

<h4>Windows</h4>

```bash
py -m ensurepip
```
Please note that the installation of pip in windows can sometimes be... _complicated_. If you are having problems making pip work, I recommend you this [video guide](https://youtu.be/c_qNC1lL4qA) on how to install it.

# File Support

Data visualizer supports the following types of files:

| File Type | Support |
| --------- | ------- |
| .csv | ‚úÖ |
| .json | ‚ùå |
| SQL | üìÖ |
| Mongodb | ‚ùå |

Keywords: `‚úÖ Yes`, `‚ùå No`, `üìÖ work in progress`

# Header bug

Currently, there's a bug where the first row of header-less `.csv` files appear messed up. The nature of bug makes it pretty difficult to fix, but with time, I think I'll be able to get it done. So, keep that in mind while working with files wihout a proper header.
